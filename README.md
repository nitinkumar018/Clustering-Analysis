# Clustering-Analysis
## The objective of this assignment is to introduce to various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN, and provide hands-on experience in applying these techniques to a real-world dataset
## Data Preprocessing
# Implement the K-Means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN algorithms using a programming language such as Python with libraries like scikit-learn
# Experiment with different parameter settings for hierarchical clustering (e.g., linkage criteria), K-means (Elbow curve for different K values) and DBSCAN (e.g., epsilon, minPts) and evaluate the clustering results
## Analyse the clusters generated by each clustering algorithm and interpret the characteristics of each cluster
# Plot the clusters with different colours to visualize the separation of data points belonging to different clusters
# Evaluate the quality of clustering using internal evaluation metrics such as silhouette score for K-Means and DBSCAN
